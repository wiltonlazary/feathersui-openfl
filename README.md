# Feathers UI 1.0.0-beta.3 for OpenFL and Haxe

[Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) is a cross-platform framework of user interface components for creative frontend projects. It is especially well-suited for games, interactive data visualizations, and other rich, multimedia experiences. With Feathers UI, you can create native apps for a wide range of devices and platforms â€” including phones, tablets, desktop computers, game consolesâ€¦ and you can even deploy to web browsers.

Built using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language and [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/). Like Feathers UI, both Haxe and OpenFL are open source, and they may be used for free in commercial projects.

ðŸš¨ **Notice:** This is a **beta** version of Feathers UI for Haxe/OpenFL. Some components and features may still be missing, and occasional bugs should be expected.
